## Purpose

`r2` is a library and command line interface for working with Cloudflare's
[R2 Storage](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/).

Cloudflare's R2 implements the [S3
API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html), attempting to allow users and
their applications to migrate easily, but importantly lacks the key, simple-to-use features provided
by the AWS CLI's [s3 subcommand](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/), as opposed
to the more complex and verbose API calls of the [s3api
subcommand](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/index.html). This CLI fills that
gap.

## Installation

To install the `r2` CLI, simply run the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/erdos-one/r2@latest
```

For more installation options, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Usage

To view the CLI's help message, run:

```bash
r2 help
```

### Available Commands

- `r2 configure` — Configure R2 access
- `r2 cp` — Copy an object from one R2 path to another
- `r2 help` — Help about any command
- `r2 ls` — List either all buckets or all objects in a bucket
- `r2 mb` — Create an R2 bucket
- `r2 mv` — Moves a local file or R2 object to another location locally or in R2.
- `r2 pipe` — Stream data from stdin to an R2 object
- `r2 presign` — Generate a pre-signed URL for a Cloudflare R2 object
- `r2 rb` — Remove an R2 bucket
- `r2 rm` — Remove an object from an R2 bucket
- `r2 sync` — Syncs directories and R2 prefixes.

To view the help message for a specific command, run:

```bash
r2 help <command>
```

For more usage information — including library usage — see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

## Progress

We're working to implement all the functionality of the AWS CLI's s3 subcommand. As of
[v0.1.0-alpha](https://github.com/erdos-one/r2/tree/v0.1.0-alpha), we have all the commands
implemented, but not all the options. We're working on it, but if you'd like to lend a helping hand,
we'd much appreciate your help!

To view the latest changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
